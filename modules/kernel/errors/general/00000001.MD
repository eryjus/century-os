# ERROR 0x00000001

## Error

The kernel reached a location in code it never should have.


## Technical

The process was able to execute code it never should have executed.  In this case, the process was terminated and then called `ProcessReschedule()`.  The process that was ended was able to get CPU time after that point.  This is a huge integrity problem and the kernel panicked.


## Resolution

IPlease contact Adam at hobbyos@eryjus.com with the specifics of your situation.
