# ERROR 0x90000001

## Error

The Heap ran out of memory and was not able to service the request


## Technical

More memory has been allocated than has been made available to the kernel heap.  The Heap was intended to be expanded as needed, but this was not implemented in the initial version of this OS.  It was intended to be added later.  Initially, the heap is sized at `HEAP_MIN_SIZE` bytes.


## Resolution

If you are running an early version of this kernel, please reach out to Adam at hobbyos@eryjus.com with the specifics of your situation.  You may need a more updated version of this kernel to suit your needs.
