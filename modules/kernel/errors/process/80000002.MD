# ERROR 0x80000002

## Error

The PID is out of range.


## Technical

PIDs are required to be from between 0 and `MAX_NUM_PID`.  Anything greater than `MAX_NUM_PID` will result is a table overflow.  Since `PID_t` is defined as an unsigned integer, it cannot be negative.

Several functions will perform this check and several functions will report this error.  The `#FILE` and `#LINE` should be reported with this error.

This error should not happen under normal circumstances.  I have taken care to not over-allocate the PID table.  Therefore, if you do get this error, it is most likely the a field that is overwritten with errant data.
