# ERROR 0x80000003

## Error

The PID does not have a valid `Process_t` structure.


## Technical

PIDs come and go.  It is possible for a process to obtain a PID for a partner process with which it will communicate and the partner process will terminate.  This will leave the process in question with a PID that is no longer valid.

In this case, the PID does not have an associated `Process_t` structure in the PID tables (the `Process_t` structure pointer is `NULL`).

This is error code is intended to be a warning message and will not crash the kernel.


## Resolution

The reason for this error it most likely application coding, not a kernel problem.  The error message is provided as a courtesy to assist in debugging application code.
