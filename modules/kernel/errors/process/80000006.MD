# ERROR 0x80000006

## Error

The PID has an invalid status.


## Technical

You received this error code because an attempt was made to operate on a process that has an invalid status.  An invalid status is either `PROC_INIT` or any other status that is not defined in `process.h` in the `ProcStatus_t` enum.

When the status is `PROC_INIT`, the `ProcessCreate()` function will hold the `Process_t.lock` until it is ready to place the process into a status queue.  This lock will prevent the PID from being passed on until the lock is released.


## Resolution

If the status of the PID is `PROC_INIT`, then something went wrong with the `ProcessCreate()` function.  In this case, there is a code but that should be raised to Adam at hobbyos@eryjus.com.

If there is some other status that is not defined in the `ProcStatus_t` enum, then most likely something has overwritten the status in code.  This situation should also be raised to Adam at hobbyos@eryjus.com.


##TODO

This error should also Zombie the PID that is no longer valid, since it will likely create issues downstream.
