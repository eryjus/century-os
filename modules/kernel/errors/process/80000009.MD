# ERROR 0x80000009

## Error

The PID has an invalid priority


## Technical

You received this error code because an attempt was made to operate on a process that has an invalid priority.  An invalid priority is one that is not defined in `process.h` in the `ProcPriority_t` enum.


## Resolution

Since that priority is not defined in the `ProcPriority_t` enum, then most likely something has overwritten the priority in code.  This situation should also be raised to Adam at hobbyos@eryjus.com.
